  <h1>Loop Through an Object in JavaScript</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      We can use for... loops, forEach(), map() and other methods to loop
      through an array in JavaScript.
    </li>
    <li>
      But in the case of ojbects, unfortunately, these methods don't work
      because objects are not iterable.
    </li>
    <li>
      This doesn't mean we can't loop through an object - but this means that we
      can't loop through an object directly the same way we do for an array.
    </li>

      <h3>How to loop through an object in JavaScript with a for…in loop</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Before ES6, we relied on the for...in method whenever we wanted to
          loop through an object.
        </li>
        <li>
          The for...in loop iterates through properties in the prototype chain.
          This means that we need to check if the property belongs to the object
          using hasOwnProperty whenever we loop through an object with the
          for…in loop
        </li>
        <li>
          To avoid the stress and difficulty of looping and to use the
          hasOwnProperty method, ES6 and ES8 introduced object static methods.
          These convert object properties to arrays, allowing us to use array
          methods directly.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>
        How to loop through an object in JavaScript with object static methods?
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          An object is made up of properties that have key-value pairs, that is
          each property always has a corresponding value.
        </li>
        <li>
          Object static methods let us extract either keys(), values(), or both
          keys and values as entries() in an array, allowing us to have as much
          flexibility over them as we do with actual arrays.
        </li>
        <li>Object.keys()</li>
        <li>Object.values()</li>
        <li>Object.entries()</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
